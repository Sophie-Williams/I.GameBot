### Solve fun coding challenges, score points and move up through the leaderboard ranks!

"I, GameBot" is a platform for game algorithm competitions, that is not only free and open source itself, but encourages participants to build their algorithms in the open and evolve their gamebots by learning from and iteratively improving upon each other's code.

You can participate in two different kinds of coding challenges:
- Competitive Games ( [TicTacToe++](https://github.com/rosedu/I.GameBot/blob/master/tictactoe/README.md) )
- Algorithmic Challenges ( [Snake Maze](https://github.com/rosedu/I.GameBot/blob/master/snake_maze/README.md), [Elevators](https://github.com/rosedu/I.GameBot/blob/master/elevators/README.md) )

In a competitive game, your game bot will accumulate points by playing against those of all your other coder friends.  
The algorithmic challenges are simulators that come with test cases which can be increasingly difficult to pass.
